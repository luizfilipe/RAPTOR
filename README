### Shading and Lighting

At the Heart of Raptor engine lies 1 uber shader Where all possible material shading types are being 
processed, like shadow occlusion and all the different maps and bones etc. Every material is rendered
using the same Ubershader, The data is being structured here in universal way and all the complex algorithms 
are also in here. The lightning is done in a "Custom shader", This is a very tiny shader that only 
calculates the lightning. If you want pong lightning you can just use the default Custom shader "custom.default.shader"
in the shader folder, If you want a different lightning type you can write one yourself . 

The ubershader you can find in "https://github.com/kajdijkstra/RAPTOR/blob/master/shaders/colorInfo.shader"


Because different maps often get lost when being exported with 3ds max if have made the engine such that
it searches for maps trough the use of the prefix in the filename of the texture, So for example:

Texture_diff.png	// Diffuse
Texture_spec.png	// Specular
Texture_ddn.png		// Normal

Animations, Vertices, Bones, transformations, Scenes and other Data structures are all preserved in Raptor engine. 


### Importer

The Assimp data structure is deeply embedded in the Raptorengine pipeline, First one needs to convert the 
specified 3d format to json using the AssimpToJson executable one can fine at:

https://github.com/kajdijkstra/RAPTOR/tree/master/assimp 

With the command line:

assimp2json.exe myScene.DAE myScene.json

One can easily convert almost any 3d data type to the preferred Assimp data type, Assimp 
currently supports 41 different file formats for reading, including COLLADA (.dae), 
3DS, DirectX X, Wavefront OBJ and Blender 3D (.blend)
