Importer

The Assimp data structure is deeply embedded in the Raptorengine pipeline, First one needs to convert the 
specified 3d format to json using the AssimpToJson executable one can fine at:

https://github.com/kajdijkstra/RAPTOR/tree/master/assimp 

With the command line:

assimp2json.exe myScene.DAE myScene.json

One can easily convert almost any 3d data type to the preferred Assimp data type, Assimp 
currently supports 41 different file formats for reading, including COLLADA (.dae), 
3DS, DirectX X, Wavefront OBJ and Blender 3D (.blend)
